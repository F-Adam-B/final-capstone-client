-Mood Cloud enables teachers to develop their student's EQ or Emotional Intelligence. It will help students
    track their ups and downs with the ability to reach out anytime during a time of crisis or despair.
-Mood Cloud provides your students the opportunity to log their moods on the fly.



Feature 1 - Students record their moods on an interactive mood grid. Moods are laid
     out left to right, representing negative to positive emotions, and top to bottom reflecting
     high to low energy levels. 
Feature 2 - Submitted moods are displayed for the student in a word cloud with each word's size corresponding
    to how frequently it has been submitted.
Feature 3 - Teachers stay up to date on their students' emotional wellbeing, 
    and may be alerted during times of crisis or despair.
