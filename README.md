# MOOD CLOUD *tentative*

## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
In this age of school bullying and shootings, sometimes it is not clear what a student's emotional state is for teachers to see. This app will give teachers and counselors access to the emotional state of their students. Students could update their emotional status every day where only the teachers have access to. If a teacher realizes a student is in a critical or depressed emotional condition, the teacher now have an opportunity to reach out immediately. In addition, students have access to record events of any incidents that made them hurtful - physically and/or emotionally. Teachers, too, will be notified and have access to these incidents as they are being logged.
